## Kubectl

The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. It's a client that communicates with a Kubernetes API server.

## Install

Follow the official [installation instructions for kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

## Verify installation

Run kubectl version to verify that kubectl is installed correctly. You won't see a server version yet because we haven't set up a cluster, but that's okay. After that you need to install minikube if you are practice.
